# Mesh Data Structure Documentation

## Overview

The mesh data structure is a foundational component in computational geometry, finite element analysis (FEA), computer graphics, and various simulation applications. It represents the spatial discretization of a geometric domain into simpler elements (typically triangles in 2D or tetrahedrons in 3D) to facilitate numerical computations and visualizations.

This documentation outlines the comprehensive data structures utilized in the mesh processing pipeline, detailing their representations, relationships, and roles within the system. Understanding these structures is crucial for effective mesh manipulation, optimization, and analysis.

## Node Coordinates (node_coord)

### Description

`node_coord` is a list that stores the spatial coordinates of each node (vertex) in the mesh. Each node is represented by its coordinates in a 2D or 3D space.

### Representation

- **Type:** `List[List[float]]`
- **Structure:** Each sublist contains the coordinates of a node.

```python
node_coord = [
    [x0, y0],  # Node 0
    [x1, y1],  # Node 1
    ...
    [xn, yn]   # Node n
]
```

### Purpose

- **Spatial Reference**: Provides the geometric positions of nodes, essential for rendering, simulation, and analysis.
- **Element Definition**: Nodes are the building blocks for defining elements (e.g., triangles) in the mesh.

## Elements (elem_nodes)

### Description

`elem_nodes` is a list that defines the mesh's elements (typically triangles in 2D). Each element is represented by a tuple of three vertex indices corresponding to the nodes that form the triangle.

### Representation

- **Type**: `List[Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]]`
- **Structure**: Each tuple contains three integers representing node indices. A value of `None` indicates a deleted or invalid triangle.

```python
elem_nodes = [
    (v0, v1, v2),  # Triangle 0
    (v3, v4, v5),  # Triangle 1
    None,          # Triangle 2 (deleted)
    ...
]
```
### Purpose

- **Mesh Topology**: Defines how nodes are interconnected to form elements, establishing the mesh's geometric and topological structure.
- **Connectivity Information**: Facilitates traversal and manipulation of the mesh by specifying which nodes constitute each element.

## Node-to-Elements Mapping (node_elems)

### Description

The node-to-elements mapping maintains a record of which elements (triangles) are connected to each node. This relationship is crucial for various mesh operations, including traversal, refinement, and optimization.

### Representation

- **Type**: `List[List[int]]`
- **Structure**: Each sublist contains the indices of elements connected to a specific node.

```python
node_elems = [
    [0, 2],      # Node 0 is part of Triangles 0 and 2
    [1, 3, 5],   # Node 1 is part of Triangles 1, 3, and 5
    ...
]
```
### Purpose

- **Element Retrieval**: Quickly identify all elements connected to a given node, facilitating operations like mesh refinement and neighbor searches
- **Efficiency**: Enables efficient access to local neighborhood information for each node, improving algorithm performance.
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduces the need to traverse all elements to find those connected to a specific node.

## Node-to-Nodes Mapping (node_nodes)

### Description

The node-to-nodes mapping maintains a record of which nodes are directly connected (adjacent) to each node. This adjacency information is vital for algorithms that require local neighborhood data, such as smoothing, optimization, and traversal algorithms.

### Representation

- **Type**: `List[List[int]]`
- **Structure**: A list where each sublist contains the indices of nodes connected to a specific node.

```python
node_nodes = [
    [1, 2],      # Node 0 is connected to Nodes 1 and 2
    [0, 2, 3],   # Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 2, and 3
    ...
]
```

### Purpose

- **Local Connectivity**: Provides immediate access to neighboring nodes for each node in the mesh.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Enhances the performance of algorithms that require local neighborhood information.
- **Topology Analysis**: Enables the identification of node adjacencies, critical for mesh quality assessment and optimization.*
